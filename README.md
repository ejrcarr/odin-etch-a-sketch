## Context
This is a version of an Etch-A-Sketch, or a pixel painting web application. 

Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this app taught me more on DOM manipulation, manipulating HTML input, and event listeners in JS.

## Features
On the top header, there is a setting cog which, on click, shows a dropdown menu of options that a player can select. The player can select between different modes, change grid-size (min 1x1, max 64x64), and toggle grid-lines. 

This application has a color and rainbow mode. 
- In the color mode, the player can choose their color with a color wheel input on the top header. The player then paints by clicking and holding while moving their cursor. 
- In rainbow mode, regular painting results in a random color selected for each grid square. 

The player has an erase button at the top, painting each tile while after click. 

On click, the painting icon at the top resumes whatever mode the player selected.
